#Question:
#Given an integer array nums of length n, you want to create an array ans of length 2n where ans[i] == nums[i] and ans[i + n] == nums[i] for 0 <= i < n (0-indexed).

#Specifically, ans is the concatenation of two nums arrays.

#Return the array ans.


#Thoughts: 這題來鬧的?

nums = [1,2,1]

print(2*nums)
