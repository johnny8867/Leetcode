#I'm not too familiar with the updating/Create Operations, mainly reads.

#Question: 

#Write an SQL query to swap all 'f' and 'm' values (i.e., change all 'f' values to 'm' and vice versa) with a single update statement and no intermediate temp table(s).

# Write your MySQL query statement below
UPDATE Salary
SET sex =
CASE WHEN sex = 'm' then 'f'
    WHEN sex = 'f' then 'm'
END
