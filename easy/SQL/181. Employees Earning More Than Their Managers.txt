#Question: 

#The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

#Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out employees who earn more than their managers. For the above table, Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.

#Note: I forgot you can select from a table more than once

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT Employee1.Name AS 'Employee' 
FROM Employee as Employee1, Employee as Employee2
WHERE Employee1.ManagerId = Employee2.Id
AND Employee1.Salary > Employee2.Salary
