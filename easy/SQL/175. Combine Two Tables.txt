#Question: 

#Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following information for each person in the Person table, regardless if there is an address for each of those people:

#FirstName, LastName, City, State

#Thoughts:

#LEFT JOIN has to be used, due to the condition of regardless if there is an address for each of those people

# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT FirstName, LastName, City, State
FROM Person
LEFT JOIN Address ON Person.PersonId = Address.PersonId
